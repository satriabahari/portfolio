        After graduating with a degree in Accounting, I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp and learned
        full-stack web development. My favorite part of programming is the
        problem-solving aspect. I love the feeling of finally figuring out a
        solution to a problem. My core stack is React, Next.js, Node.js, and
        MongoDB. I am also familiar with TypeScript and Prisma. I am always
        looking to learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a
        full-time position as a software developer.

        When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy playing video games, watching movies,
        and playing with my dog. I also enjoy learning new things. I am
        currently learning about history and philosophy. I&apos;m also learning
        how to play the guitar
